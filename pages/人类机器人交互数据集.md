- Here are some notable datasets and research papers related to human-robot interaction (HRI):
- 1. **[CongreG8 Dataset](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247364)**: This dataset includes human-group interaction data, robot-group interaction data, personality data, and custom human/robot interaction questionnaires. It aims to reveal interactions at the group level⁴.

- 3. **[RH20T Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00595)**: This comprehensive dataset contains over 110,000 contact-rich robot manipulation sequences across diverse skills, contexts, robots, and camera viewpoints. It is designed to help agents generalize to hundreds of real-world skills with multi-modal perception³.
