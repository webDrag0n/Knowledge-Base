# Project Proposal: A Learning-based Control Methodology for Transitioning VTOL UAVs
- ## 1. Introduction
  
  Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) UAVs are becoming increasingly important in a variety of applications, including package delivery, surveillance, and disaster relief. A key challenge in the operation of VTOL UAVs is the transition between vertical and horizontal flight modes, which typically involves complex control systems. The transition phase requires precise control to ensure smooth flight paths and minimize energy consumption.
  
  In this project, we propose a learning-based control methodology for the transitioning phase of VTOL UAVs. By converting the transition path into a "moving hovering point," the UAV can achieve smoother transitions by continuously trying to hover toward this dynamically moving target. We aim to implement a path planning algorithm and a reinforcement learning (RL) hovering controller based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to enable efficient and robust control during this transition.
- ## 2. Objectives
  
  The main objectives of this project are as follows:
- Develop a path planning algorithm that defines a moving hovering point for the UAV during the transition phase.
- Implement a reinforcement learning-based hovering controller using the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to enable smooth and optimal transition control.
- Evaluate the performance of the proposed control system in terms of smoothness and stability of the actual flight trace of the VTOL UAV.
- Compare the proposed method with existing VTOL UAV transition control techniques to assess its effectiveness.
- ## 3. Methodology
- ### 3.1 Path Planning Algorithm
  
  The transition path from vertical to horizontal flight mode can be defined by a set of intermediate waypoints that the UAV must pass through. In our approach, we propose to model the transition as a moving hovering point in 3D space. This point will move along the desired transition path, guiding the UAV’s control system. By treating this target as a dynamic "hovering point," we avoid the need for rigid waypoint tracking and allow the UAV to continuously adjust its trajectory as it moves through the transition zone.
  
  The key components of the path planning algorithm are:
- **Path Representation**: A spline or a Bezier curve to model the smooth transition trajectory between vertical and horizontal flight modes.
- **Moving Hovering Point**: The target point moves along the path with time, adjusting the UAV's flight parameters to maintain smooth transitions.
- ### 3.2 Reinforcement Learning Controller
  
  To control the UAV's motion towards the moving hovering point, we will utilize the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method. SAC is known for its sample efficiency and ability to handle continuous action spaces, making it a suitable choice for UAV control.
  
  The controller will be trained in a simulation environment where the UAV learns to adapt its control inputs to minimize the deviation from the moving hovering point. The SAC algorithm will optimize the UAV's policy, balancing exploration and exploitation to achieve smooth, stable transitions.
  
  Key components of the RL controller:
- **State Space**: The state space will include the UAV's position, velocity, orientation, and other relevant flight parameters (e.g., control surface angles, thrust).
- **Action Space**: The action space will consist of continuous control inputs (e.g., motor thrusts, control surface deflections).
- **Reward Function**: The reward will be designed to penalize deviations from the moving hovering point and excessive control inputs, promoting smooth transitions.
- ### 3.3 Evaluation Metrics
  
  To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we will assess the smoothness and stability of the UAV's transition during the flight. The following metrics will be considered:
- **Path Smoothness**: The deviation between the actual flight trace and the planned path will be measured, with lower deviations indicating smoother transitions.
- **Control Efficiency**: The amount of energy (e.g., thrust) used during the transition will be evaluated, aiming to minimize energy consumption while maintaining stability.
- **Flight Stability**: The UAV's ability to remain stable during the transition phase, including factors such as oscillations, instability, and control input fluctuations.
- ### 3.4 Comparison with Existing Methods
  
  We will compare our proposed method with several existing VTOL UAV transition control methods to benchmark its performance. The following methods will be considered for comparison:
  
  1. **PID-based Control**: A classical PID controller, which is often used for VTOL UAVs to handle transitions, will serve as a baseline.
  2. **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**: MPC is a well-known method for optimal control of dynamic systems, and it has been applied to VTOL UAVs for smooth transition management.
  3. **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)-based Control**: A data-driven approach using GPR has been employed for real-time control of VTOL UAV transitions by learning a model of the system's dynamics.
  4. **State-of-the-Art Method – Reinforcement Learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: PPO is another reinforcement learning algorithm that has been successfully applied to UAV control, and it will serve as a representative of current state-of-the-art methods for VTOL transition control.
- ## 4. Expected Results
  
  We expect that the learning-based control method using SAC will outperform traditional methods in terms of smoothness and efficiency during the transition phase. By continuously adapting to the moving hovering point, the UAV should exhibit more stable and smoother flight paths, with reduced oscillations and energy consumption compared to PID and MPC-based methods. Additionally, the RL-based approach is expected to be more flexible and adaptive to dynamic conditions, leading to improved performance over GPR-based control methods.
  
  We hypothesize that the SAC controller will outperform the PPO-based method due to its more efficient exploration strategy and its ability to handle continuous action spaces in a more robust manner.
