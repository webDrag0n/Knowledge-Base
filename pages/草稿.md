- To analyze the Q-learning process for the given gridworld and episodes, we will work through the parts step by step.
- ### (a) Q-Learning Calculations
- #### Initialization
  We start with all Q-values initialized to 0:
- \( Q(X, \rightarrow) = 0 \)
- \( Q(X, \downarrow) = 0 \)
- \( Q(Y, \leftarrow) = 0 \)
- \( Q(Y, \downarrow) = 0 \)
- \( Q(Z, exit) = 0 \)
- \( Q(W, exit) = 0 \)
- #### Episode 1
  
  1. **Step 1**: From \( X \) to \( Y \) with reward \( r_1 = 0 \):
   \[
   Q(X, \rightarrow) \leftarrow Q(X, \rightarrow) + \alpha (r_1 + \gamma \max_a Q(Y, a) - Q(X, \rightarrow)) = 0 + 1 (0 + 0.5 \cdot 0 - 0) = 0
   \]
  
  2. **Step 2**: From \( Y \) to \( W \) with reward \( r_3 = 0 \):
   \[
   Q(Y, \downarrow) \leftarrow Q(Y, \downarrow) + \alpha (r_3 + \gamma \max_a Q(W, a) - Q(Y, \downarrow)) = 0 + 1 (0 + 0.5 \cdot 0 - 0) = 0
   \]
  
  3. **Step 3**: From \( W \) to done with reward \( r_5 = 10 \):
   \[
   Q(W, exit) \leftarrow Q(W, exit) + \alpha (r_5 - Q(W, exit)) = 0 + 1 (10 - 0) = 10
   \]
- #### Episode 2
  
  1. **Step 1**: From \( X \) to \( Z \) with reward \( r_2 = 0 \):
   \[
   Q(X, \downarrow) \leftarrow Q(X, \downarrow) + \alpha (r_2 + \gamma \max_a Q(Z, a) - Q(X, \downarrow)) = 0 + 1 (0 + 0.5 \cdot 0 - 0) = 0
   \]
  
  2. **Step 2**: From \( Z \) to done with reward \( r_4 = 1 \):
   \[
   Q(Z, exit) \leftarrow Q(Z, exit) + \alpha (r_4 - Q(Z, exit)) = 0 + 1 (1 - 0) = 1
   \]
- ### Updated Q-values after episodes:
- \( Q(X, \rightarrow) = 0 \)
- \( Q(X, \downarrow) = 0 \)
- \( Q(Y, \downarrow) = 0 \)
- \( Q(W, exit) = 10 \)
- \( Q(Z, exit) = 1 \)
- #### Convergence Check
  We repeat the episodes, but as the maximum Q-value for actions \( X \rightarrow Y \) and \( X \downarrow Z \) remains 0 after multiple runs, these values will not change unless influenced by actions leading to different states.
  
  **Final Q-values**:
- \( Q(X, \rightarrow) = 0 \)
- \( Q(X, \downarrow) = 0 \)
- \( Q(Y, \downarrow) = 0 \)
- ### (b1) Reward Setups That Could Result in Optimal Behavior
  
  For the agent to potentially learn the optimal path \( X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow W \) under Q-learning, the rewards must encourage this path without discouragement from alternate paths. Thus:
  
  1. **S2:** \( (r_1=0, r_2=0, r_3=0, r_4=1, r_5=10) \) - This could lead to \( Y \rightarrow W \) being favorable.
  2. **S3:** \( (r_1=5, r_2=5, r_3=5, r_4=5, r_5=5) \) - Every transition has positive rewards, potentially leading to the optimal path.
  3. **S4:** \( (r_1=1, r_2=0, r_3=0, r_4=2, r_5=1) \) - \( Y \rightarrow W \) could be made more appealing than alternate paths.
- ### (b2) Reward Setups That Guarantee Optimal Behavior
  
  1. **S2:** With \( r_5 = 10 \) as a strong incentive, the optimal path \( X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow W \) is guaranteed to be the best.
  2. **S3:** Rewards are balanced across all transitions, ensuring no path is strictly suboptimal.
- ### (c) Analyzing New Reward Setup
  
  Adding \( r_5 \) to the \( W \) transition provides a strong incentive to take that path. Therefore:
- **S2 and S3** would continue to guarantee optimal behavior since rewards for \( Y \rightarrow W \) are high.
- The additional transition reinforces the attractiveness of the optimal path due to \( r_5 \).
  
  Thus, with this added transition and a high reward at the end, both S2 and S3 setups would indeed guarantee optimal behavior under the modified conditions.
