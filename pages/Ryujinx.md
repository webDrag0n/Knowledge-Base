	- **Ryujinx supports [portable mode!](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/wiki/Ryujinx-Setup-&-Configuration-Guide#portable-mode) If you set up portable mode, note that any time the %appdata% folder is referenced in the guide below, it is referring to your custom data folder.**
		- 1.  Now that you've downloaded the _Ryujinx_ archive, open it and extract the contents of the publish folder onto your hard drive in the location of your choice.
		- 2.  Navigate to where you extracted the _Ryujinx_ files, and double-click on _Ryujinx.exe_. This will launch the emulator and you will be met with the following message (don't worry; this is normal!):

	- Now that your keys are installed, it's time to install a firmware. Make sure you have an untrimmed XCI file of a recent game cartridge you dumped, or have compiled your dumped firmware into a ZIP file.
		- 1.  Open _Ryujinx_. There should be no warning about KEYS.md anymore; if you still get the warning, go back through the prod.keys steps and ensure you have placed the file correctly.
		- 2.  Now that _Ryujinx_ is open, click _Tools > Firmware > Install from XCI/ZIP_
		  此处的firmware可以从[Switch Firmwares - Darthsternie's Firmware Archive](https://darthsternie.net/switch-firmwares/)处获取

		- 3.  Using the _Ryujinx_ window, navigate to the location of your dumped XCI file and click _Open_. You will be asked to confirm whether you want to install the firmware. Make sure your prod.keys are at least as new as the firmware you are installing!
